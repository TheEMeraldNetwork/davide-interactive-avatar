Giampiero,Marin√≤,Bark.com,Chief Commercial Officer (CCO),"Giampiero is a very good professional that - in my opinion - suits the consultant dresses perfectly, especially for three main reasons:    Capability to ""get the things done"": Giampiero always comes up with a solution in his hands; I don't remember him coming back to senior colleagues or to his manager with an open issue, but always with a robust and sound proposal    Capability to leverage on (and to delegate to) other colleagues, BCG internal research center, clients: Giampiero is really resourceful and bright in understanding who to engage and how to work with others, also extremely able to push resources that do not report to him to carry on with their tasks (colleagues or clients)    Willingness to help other team members, also helped by his speed in understanding new problems and topics and his capability to play outside his confidence area: I've always seen Giampiero (especially after an initial ramp-up stage) keen to help others, even senior team members, both on basic operational tasks and on high-level thinking and problem solving","08/30/12, 01:00 PM",
